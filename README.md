Covariance functions implemented as Kernels, in Ocaml. Work in progress!

## Introduction ##

This library initially started as an OCaml implementation of [Temporal Kernel Descriptors for Learning with Time-sensitive Patterns](http://www.doyensahoo.com/uploads/5/3/7/3/53734297/tkd__sdm_2016_.pdf) by Sahoo, Sharma, Hoi, and Zhao. It is a online kernel learning methodology with kernels dedicated to detecting time-sensitive patterns and associating them with traditional machine learning features.

Eventually more standard kernels such squared exponential and matern were added. Composition of these kernels is already possible and will continue to be extended.
