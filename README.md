Online Multi-resolution Kernels, in Ocaml. Work in progress!

## Introduction ##

This library is an OCaml implementation of [Temporal Kernel Descriptors for Learning with Time-sensitive Patterns](http://www.doyensahoo.com/uploads/5/3/7/3/53734297/tkd__sdm_2016_.pdf) by Sahoo, Sharma, Hoi, and Zhao. It is a online kernel learning methodology with kernels dedicated to detecting time-sensitive patterns and associating them with traditional machine learning features.
